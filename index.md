## My private projects
**They are not really private projects, just because I try to develop them, but finally I have no time to finish them, if I finish them in the future, I may public them as the public projects. If you are interested with them, you can try to send a email with me to discuss about them.**

### 1. jrmxp
**This project is a startup project(might not be..). It is a extend project on Rpg maker engine, but not for MV, it is for Rpg maker xp. The RMXP is based on Ruby, and not open source(Of course). There are some nice projects for RMXP in the github, like the mkxp. But they are not just for Android, or hardly use for Android. So I try to build myself a new one.**
**It is based on Jruby and Libgdx. Jruby could run the ruby scripts from RMXP on Android, and libgdx is used to port most of actions like show the images, maps and play sounds. And as my plan the final project could process most of win32api actions just for Android, such as input words. I will try to simulate them in the project.**
**But it is still slow to develop, I have no idea when I can finish it.**

### 2. dlibforandroid
**The dlib library is an open source library for the face detection, but it is based on C, it is little bit hard to use on Android, that\`s the reason I build this project. I try to port functions from it to Android(Java), however sadly, I didn\`t finish it and it stopped for a long time**

### 3. rpgmakermvplayer
**It is a project which is based on my exist public one RMMV-android-deployment. It is a common Rpg maker mv player which can add and play mv games, as there are some similar players in the market, so I didn\`s public it. However, it do have some features which are from my createive, like to store the save file in the storage.**
